# This script manages the scripts related to the whole statistical model. Starting from the result of the static analysis, arrives to the generation of the csv file per database of samples.
# The script requires as input a python array of the names of the folders in the graph folder related to the databases which samples we want to extract the features. These folders must contain the files created by the static analysis. The python array structure has to be mantained even if there is only one database.
# It requires as well a flag (Y or N) if you desire to write the files during the intermediate steps (from the graph folder to the call to the families/package one). If the flag is set on N it will only write the final csv. When the flag is set on Y the script is a lot slowert output part.
# Indicate first the databases folders in this format: database1:database2:database3. Then indicate Y or N (--writefiles) as second argument.
# The features files (one per indicated database) will be created as "name_of_the_database".csv files in the folders Features/Families and Features/Packages.
